# Handover Prompt for Ascension Lua Unlocker Project

Hello Jules,

This is a handover for the 'Ascension Lua Unlocker' project. Your mission is to continue the work of reverse-engineering `Ascension.exe` to create a stable Lua execution framework.

## Project Summary & Key Findings:

*   **Goal:** Unlock the Lua engine in `Ascension.exe` by bypassing the game's protections.
*   **The Lock:** We've successfully identified the primary lock. In `Ascension.exe`, the function that should call `FrameScript_ExecuteBuffer` has been replaced with a `jmp` at address `0x0040B7D0`.
*   **Target Function:** The address of `FrameScript_ExecuteBuffer` is confirmed to be `0x00406D70`.
*   **Defenses:** The main anti-debugging measure found is the presence of over 1700 `int3` breakpoint traps, likely handled by SEH.
*   **Injection Attempts:** We have attempted two dynamic injection methods (`CreateRemoteThread` and `APC Injection`) to call `0x00406D70` directly.
    *   **Result:** Both methods fail. While they don't crash the game (it minimizes), the Lua code does not produce any visible effect (`print`, `SendChatMessage`). Critically, an attempt to inject an infinite loop (`while true do end`) also failed to hang the game.

## Current Diagnosis:

The evidence strongly suggests that `FrameScript_ExecuteBuffer` must be called from the game's **main thread**. Our injection attempts have been executing from other thread contexts, causing the function to fail silently. This is a common requirement for UI-related functions in game engines.

## Your Next Objective: Main Thread Hooking

Your task is to solve this thread context problem by hooking a function that executes on the main game loop.

1.  **Identify a Hooking Candidate:** You must analyze the provided disassembly (`out/ascension_disasm_fresh.txt`) to find a suitable function to hook. Since we cannot use a debugger, you will need to rely on static analysis. A good strategy is to programmatically find the most frequently called functions in the executable. One of these is likely to be a core loop or utility function that runs in the main thread.
2.  **Develop the Hook:** Once you have a candidate function, you must develop the shellcode to perform the hook. This involves:
    a.  Overwriting the start of the target function with a `jmp` to your code.
    b.  Your code will call `FrameScript_ExecuteBuffer`.
    c.  Crucially, your code must then execute the original instructions it overwrote and jump back to the original function to ensure the game continues to run without crashing.
3.  **Update the Injector:** Modify `scripts/injector.py` to inject this new, more complex hooking payload.

This is a difficult task that requires precision. All the necessary analysis files (`ANALYSIS.md`, disassembly outputs) are in the workspace. Good luck.
